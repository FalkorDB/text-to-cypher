    description = "Answer user questions based on the data in the given graph. 

IMPORTANT: Before using this tool, you should:
1. First explore available graph resources to see what graphs are available
2. Use the resource URIs to understand the schema of each graph
3. Resources are available at URIs like 'falkordb://graph/{graph_name}'
4. Each resource contains the graph's schema information in JSON format
5. Use the schema information to understand what entities and relationships exist

Available graph resources can be discovered through the MCP resource system. Each graph resource contains:
- Entity types (nodes) with their attributes and data types
- Relationship types (edges) with source and target entity types
- Complete schema information to help formulate appropriate questions

Example workflow:
1. Check available resources to see graphs like 'falkordb://graph/social', 'falkordb://graph/knowledge_base'
2. Read the resource content to understand the schema
3. Use this tool with an appropriate graph_name and question based on the schema"
